## Share it!
I have personally not come across a clean implementation on a WebAPI, which is the reason that I started building this up. There are quite a lot of improvements and fixes along the way from the day I started out. Thanks to the community for the support and suggestions.
Please share this Repository within your developer community, if you think that this would a difference! Thanks.
